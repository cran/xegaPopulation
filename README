# The R script xegaPopulation.R

The directory xegaPopulation contains the implementation 
of the functions of the population layer of 
a genetic algorithm. 

The R script xegaPopulation.R generates

1. the man pages of the package.
2. the pdf documentation of the package.
3. the compilation and installation of the package.
   (You  must adapt the variables path and pName
    in the script xegaPopulation.R:

    path<-"~/dev/iaa/genetic/xega/"
    pName<-"xegaPopulation"

    to the directory where you copy the package.

You need to install the R-package devtools for this R script.

There are two ways to use the code:

1. Change into the R directory which contains the code, start R and load all code files:

source("xegaPopulation.R")

Note that the package xegaPopulation provides the functions of the population 
layer to all genetic algorithms of the family sgX:
sga, sgp, sgPerm, (and  sge, sgde).

Use the pdf-Manual! 

2. Adapt the path in xegaPopulation.R and install the library xegaPopulation:

Rscript xegaPopulation.R

Restart R and

library(xegaPopulation)

You get all elements of the package by

xegaPopulation::

and pressing the tabulator.

You get the man page by e.g 

?NextPopulation

or 

help(NextPopulation)

All examples given on a man page can be executed by

example(NextPopulation)

Note that man pages and examples are only available, if you install 
the package as a library.
